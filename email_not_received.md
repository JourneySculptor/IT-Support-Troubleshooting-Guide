## Steps to Isolate the Problem
1. **Check the internet connection.**
    -Since email reception requires an active internet connection, verify that the internet is working.
2. **Check email client settings.**
    - Ensure that **IMAP/SMTP server settings** are configured correctly and that login credentials are accurate.
3. **Check the email server status.**
    - Review the status of the email provider’s servers (check for outages or service disruptions).
4. **Check the spam folder.**
    - Make sure that the incoming emails are not being mistakenly marked as spam and moved to the spam folder.

## Root Cause Analysis
  - If **emails are delayed or not received** from a specific account, the issue may lie with **email server settings** or **filtering** (e.g., spam filtering).
  - If **the issue affects all accounts**, the **email server** may be down or there could be a **network issue**.
  - If **emails are in the spam folder**, the problem could be caused by **incorrect spam filter settings**.
