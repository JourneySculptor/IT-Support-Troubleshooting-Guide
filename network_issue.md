## Questions to Ask
1. Are **other devices** also unable to connect to the network?
2. Is the issue happening on **Wi-Fi or wired (Ethernet) connection**?

## Steps to Isolate the Problem
1. **Check if the internet is working on other devices.**
   - If **other devices can connect**, the issue is likely with **this specific device**.
   - If **no devices can connect**, the issue might be with the **router, modem, or ISP**.
2. **Restart the router and modem.**
   - **Unplug** them from power for **30 seconds**, then **plug them back in**.
3. **Check if the device is connected to the correct network.**
   - Sometimes, devices **automatically connect** to a different network (e.g., a public Wi-Fi).
4. **Try using a wired (Ethernet) connection instead of Wi-Fi.**
   - If **Ethernet works** but **Wi-Fi doesnâ€™t**, the issue is with the **Wi-Fi settings**.
5. **Run a network diagnostic tool.**
   - **Windows**: `Network Troubleshooter`
   - **Mac**: `Wireless Diagnostics`
   - **Linux**: `ping` or `traceroute` commands

## **Root Cause Analysis**
- If **all devices cannot connect**, it might be an **ISP outage** or a **router issue**.
- If **only one device has the issue**, it might be a **misconfigured network setting** or a **driver issue**.
- If **the device connects via Ethernet but not Wi-Fi**, the **Wi-Fi adapter** or **settings** may be incorrect.

## **Suggested Solutions**
1. **Reset the network adapter settings** (Windows: `netsh winsock reset`).
2. **Update the network drivers** (especially if this happened after a system update).
3. **Factory reset the router** (if all else fails and ISP confirms no issue).
4. **Contact the ISP** to check for **known outages** in the area.
